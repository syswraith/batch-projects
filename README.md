# batch-projects
A collection of batch projects I do from time to time

- [BAT Intel Gatherer]()
BAT Intel Gatherer is a batch script file that runs a set of given commands and compiles the information gathered into one .txt file. It runs on any device that is capable of executing a batch script (i.e. Windows ONLY). You can even run it from a portable device.
- [Flooder]()
This neat little batch script calls itself over and over again, and floods the victim's computer with multiple windows, folders, and random user accounts.
